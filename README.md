This analysis involes trascriptomoic study of Prevnar-13 which is a vaccine against pneumococcal disease.
It covers 13 serotypes responsible for invasive pneumococcal disease
children aged 6 weeks to 5 years  and adults â‰¥50 years are admistered with the vaccine, especially those at risk for pneumococcal disease.


The immune response involves:
1. chemically linked to a carrier protein MHC class II molecules.
2. CD4+ T-helper cells co-stimulatory signals to B cells
3. B cells undergo:
      Class switching
      Affinity maturation
      Plasma cells and memory B cells.
   
Microarray:
The data is extracted in this analysis is from Microarray.
Microarray has a solid surface with fixed DNA probes, purified mRNA is converted to labelled cDNA and allowed to bind against the fixed probes.
Post this step singles are captured and gene expression is measured.
